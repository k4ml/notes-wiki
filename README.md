Keeping a public wiki to keep notes on what I have learned is something that I have been doing since at university. My old wiki is currently in this [mercurial repo](https://hg.sr.ht/~k4ml/k4ml_wiki/browse). It originally written with dokuwiki.

This is the new incarnation of the wiki. Started as Github Wiki, I have moved over to GitBook which provide much easier editing and organization - Github Wiki only has flat structure. Now notes are organized into folder, representing certain topic.

The good thing about GitBook is that it still get sync with github repo, so I can made changes either through their web editor or my local editor and then push the changes to Github.

I am moved to start using GitBook for my wiki after I bumped into [https://www.aizatto.com/](https://www.aizatto.com/).

### Importing from Github wiki

It's not directly supported yet but since the wiki is also a git repo, you can push it to a new repo which gitbook can import later.
